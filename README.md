## Overview

Codex stores accounts, sessions, MCP entries, Skills, smart-router settings, and relay configuration across multiple files under `~/.codex`. Multi-account switching, quota exhaustion, third-party model setup, session cleanup, and config drift quickly turn day-to-day work into hand-editing TOML, JSON, and SQLite.

AiMaMi is built with **Tauri 2, React, and Rust**. It consolidates these high-frequency workflows — including smart routing and relay management — into a single desktop app that reads and writes Codex data locally, reducing the risk of manual file edits.

## Core Capabilities

| Module | Pain point addressed |
| --- | --- |
| **Account management** | Switching accounts by editing `auth.json`; scattered quota views; cumbersome import/export |
| **Auto-switch** | Work stops when 5-hour or weekly quota runs out; need automatic fallback and Codex restart |
| **Smart router** | Use relay models inside Codex Desktop while keeping historical threads resumable |
| **Relay management** | Provider setup, connectivity tests, import/export, and router diagnostics |
| **Session management** | Safely inspect, analyze, and bulk-clean local threads from the real index |
| **MCP / Skills** | Manage MCP entries and Skills lifecycle in the UI, with backup and restore |
| **Plugins** | Unified toggles for built-in extensions (e.g. web tools, image support) |
| **Custom instructions** | Manage only the AiMaMi-managed block in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, with preview and rollback |
| **System maintenance** | Diagnose, clean, rebuild registry, force-quit Codex, fix common config issues |
| **Settings & runtime** | Theme, language, quota refresh, API proxy, update checks; tray and macOS notch quota display |

**Smart router note:** Relay models are forwarded through AiMaMi's local proxy. Keep AiMaMi running while Codex uses relay models.
